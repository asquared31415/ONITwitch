# 1.2.7 (2025-04-16)

Update to U55 (thanks to Sgt_Imalas for handling the internal DLC restriction changes while I was having computer
problems!)

## Fixes

- "Start Voting" button in the pause menu now correctly maintains its "clicked" state
- "Uninsulate Tiles" event should now prevent liquids and gasses from flowing through the tile while the change is
  happening
    - the way this works is a little weird, if you experience any bugs with this please let me know
- Surprise Box can no longer spawn objects with a default temperature of above 85C
- "Spawn Duplicant" event can no longer spawn bionic duplicants
    - this is a temporary workaround for bugs that made them useless, I hope to re-enable this in the future
